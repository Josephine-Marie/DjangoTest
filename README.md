Welcome!
To complete this exercise, please implement the following steps:

1. clone this repository and run it on your local machine
2. create a file input form for a .csv file and a string (name of the file) under "/input"

(extension:
a. create a user model with first name, last name, e-mail and job title
b. make it so that only logged in users can upload files)

3. create a page where all uploaded .csv files get listed in order of their upload date and time (under "/files")
OR list them in order of their place in the coordinate system, starting at the source (way higher difficulty, what do you think, Hendrik?)

(extension: 
a. also show user who uploaded file)

4. upload all changes to this repository
